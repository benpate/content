## A loosely coupled library for building and editing HTML content

Nebula is a container format for rich HTML content, along with a reference library of HTML layouts and widgets, along with transactions to change items within the container.

Each nebula item has a view-only method along ith an editor method.  This lets developers create in-place editors for all kinds of applications.

Instead of storing content items in a natural, nested format, nebula puts each one in a single-dimensional array, which simplifies direct access to individual content items.

## Widget Library (in-progress)

* WYSIWYG content editor
* Image Uploads (with hooks into [mediaserver](https://github.com/benpate/mediaserver))
* OEmbed content for pictures, videos, and other rich objects
* more to come

## Layout Library (in progress)

* Row Layouts
* Responsive Columns (coming soon)
* Tab Control (coming soon)
